SimpleXML
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cedricbou/simple-xml.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cedricbou/simple-xml)

Easily play with XML content without having to use object mapping or complicated API. 

Inspiration
-----------

For FiddleWith.it, I was in need of an easy XML browsing API, which would map nicely with JRuby. 

Key Concepts
--------

- No object mapping
- Namespaces support
- Safe deep browsing (automatically protects from null pointer exception while browsing through nodes).
- Read only


Installation and Configuration
------------------------------
